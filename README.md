### Hello and Welcome on my GH Profile

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a **Nerd**, **Amateur Radio Operator**, **Linux System Engineer** and proud **Family Father**. My journey into the world of tech has been a unique one, shaped by a decade of working as a paramedic. While Iâ€™ve left that career behind, it gave me invaluable life experience and the ability to remain calm and analytical under pressureâ€”skills I now bring to the IT world.
